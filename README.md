## Introduction

This project is part of the EU H2020 [SynchroniCity](https://synchronicity-iot.eu) project and it is an add on for the [SynchroniCity IoT Data Marketplace](https://github.com/caposseleDigicat/SynchroniCityDataMarketplace).

- You will find the source code of this project in GitHub [here](https://github.com/caposseleDigicat/NGSI-import)

Thanks to this component you will be able to import data sources specification directly on the IoT Data Marketplace. This project reads from a file a list of NGSI pairs [Entity Type] 
[Entity ID] and creates the respective data source specification on the marketplace. Inside the `bin` folder you will find 3 different version already compiled for `Mac OSX`, `Windows`, and `Linux`. If you wish to recompile it, just read the following section.

## How to Build

Requirements: [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/doc/install)

To build the binary for your `OS` and `architecrure` just run:

```
GOOS=[OS] GOARCH=[ARCH] go build main.go utility.go
```

where [OS] and [ARCH] are your Operating System and Architecture respectively. Some examples for OSX, Windows and Linux (with 32bit architecture) are:

```
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=386 go build main.go utility.go

GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build main.go utility.go

GOOS=linux GOARCH=386 go build main.go utility.go
```

These commads will create a `main` (`main.exe` for windows) executable file. For your reference, you can find a similar set of commands inside the script `build.sh`.
